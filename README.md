# Interfood shiny app <img src="logo.png" align="right" width="120" height="140"/>

The essence of this small free application is that, based on your ratings collected in an excel file, it searches the given weekly menu of Interfood and offers you suggestions so that you can find your favourites in their endlessly large selection as soon as possible. :)

### Usage

Simply upload the excel, enter the days you want to order, and you'll see the suggestions.
The application simply searches for words, so you can even search for your favourite types of food, instead of the full product name (e.g. chicken breast).
